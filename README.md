# Hewlett Packard Analysis

## Overview of Project

After creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and quering these relationships using SQL, it was determined that Hewlett Packard was going to have a mass influx of employees retiring. The manager gave two additional follow-up assignments: using SQL, determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in the company's mentorship program. The overall goal is prepare the manager for the upcoming "silver tsunami" as many of the current employees reach retirement age.

### Purpose

The purpose of the assignment was to take the six seperate sets of data, establish primary relationship datapoints across these datasets to ultimately determine the number of retiring employees. The assignment is intended to allow the manager to visiually see the number of employees retiring, along with their duty titles, to figure out the mentorship eligibility.

## Analysis Results

The following results were determined after using specific SQL queries based on the identified criteria:

  - There are more than 70,000 Pewlett Hackard employees that are approaching retirement.
  - Overall, the Senior Staff consists of 50,000 of the above number of employees with only two of those being managers.
  - The analysis identified over 1,500 Pewlett Hackard employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.
  - Of those 1,500 that are eligible for the mentorship program, over 700 of them are in a senior leadership position.
